ToDo
====

 1. Allow for scanning the repository to see for which packages there are
    newer versions in the AUR. (This could be complicated, but would be
    very very useful.) (syntax: repo sync)

 2. Read the database file to make updating faster and more pleasant:
    repo-add will only be called with the files that are absolutely
    necessary.

 3. Split out package.go into a goulash/pacman package
