A brief explanation of the files in this directory:

    `repoctl_completion.bash`: In case you use bash, you can install the
        bash completion file into `/usr/share/bash-completion/` as the
        file `repoctl`.
        This file is generated automatically by a function in the Cobra
        library that is used for the command line interface of repoctl.

    `repoctl_completion.zsh`: In case you use Zsh, you can install the Zsh completion
        file for repo-keep, which makes using `repoctl` much easier. Put it in
        the directory `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/` as the file `_repoctl`.
        This file must currently be maintained manually, in contrast to the
        bash completion file above. :-(
