A brief explanation of the files in this directory:

    `zsh_completion`: In case you use Zsh, you can install the Zsh completion
        file for repo-keep, which makes using `repo` much easier. Put it in
        the directory `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/` as the file `_repo`.

    `PKGBUILD`: Arch Linux package build script.
